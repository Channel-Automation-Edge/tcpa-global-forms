        <h4 className="list-label">Analytics Cookies (PostHog):</h4>
        <p className="paragraph">We use PostHog, a third-party analytics service, to collect information about how visitors use our website.

            <dl className="list-description">This is a persistent cookie that uniquely identifies a user for analytical purposes. It allows PostHog to track user behavior across multiple sessions. This cookie expires in approximately one year. The data collected includes a unique user identifier (distinct_id) and session information ($sesid). While this cookie has a long duration, the session data it contains (e.g., timestamps) is updated on each new session, effectively making it function partly as a session cookie as well.</dl>

This cookie also expires in approximately one year. The data collected includes a unique user identifier (distinct_id), session information ($sesid), and initial referrer and landing page URLs ($initial_person_info). This information may include query parameters in the URL that could potentially contain personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, location data, or other details provided in the URL.</dl>
